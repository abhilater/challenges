What do you want?
===================
The first thing is to find out what you want, and this is perhaps the hardest thing and this is the thing that you 
need to keep coming back to again and again.

2 questions
1. What do you want? 
* Keep learning and not limit myself to anything.
* Cultivate the skill to be happy/peaceful/meditative
* Identify what I am uniquely good at and try to productize myself
* Identify the thing I enjoy the most and keep at it, get to the bottom of it

2. Why am I doing this?

Staying Technical
===================
* The key to staying technical is to **stay ahead of the curve**, to keep on with your technical skills.
* Stay visible as a technical person, a technical thought leader, someone who knows his tech stuff
